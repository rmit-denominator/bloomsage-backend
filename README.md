## Virtual Environment
Note that for this the package venv is to be used.

In short, a virtual environment will help us manage an isolated version of python interpreter. And so too installed packages. In this way. Different project will not have to depends on the same packages installation and have to conflict. Read the link above explain and show it well.

## Build on local
### Docker Build
```docker
docker compose up --build
```
### Poetry or Pip
```bash
# Create a virtual environment, navigate to your root directory and run:
python -m venv .venv
# Activate the environment, use:
source .venv/bin/activate
python ./ml_fetch.py
```
